# Practice_2020

* KickOff January 18th

## Day 1
> 1. Given an array of 2n integers, your task is to group these integers into n pairs of integer, say (a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an, bn) which makes sum of min(ai, bi) for all i from 1 to n as large as possible.
> 2. Let's call an array A a mountain if the following properties hold: 
A.length >= 3
There exists some 0 < i < A.length - 1 such that A[0] < A[1] < ... A[i-1] < A[i] > A[i+1] > ... > A[A.length - 1]
Given an array that is definitely a mountain, return any i such that A[0] < A[1] < ... A[i-1] < A[i] > A[i+1] > ... > A[A.length - 1].

## Day 2
> 1. Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].
Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.
> 2. Given a string S that only contains "I" (increase) or "D" (decrease), let N = S.length.
Return any permutation A of [0, 1, ..., N] such that for all i = 0, ..., N-1: <br>
If S[i] == "I", then A[i] < A[i+1] <br>
If S[i] == "D", then A[i] > A[i+1] <br>
